ABSTRACT
A transcript of a dialogue on independent,
self-directed learning is presented. The three presenters, Ron Gross,
Tom Hebert, and Allen Tough, and audience members discuss learning,
schooling, discovery, motivation, public policy, and how all of these
affect values and the quality of life. Nonformal, nonaffiliated
learning--which takes place at home or in informal settings like
libraries, enthusiasts' clubs, and organized networks of learners--is
considered. Surveys of deliberate efforts by adults to gaini some very
definite knowledge and skill have found that 20 percent of adult
learning is planned by a professional who leads a class or group,
while 80 percent of adult learning is planned by the learner. Also
included in the 80 percent are self-help groups of peers with tha
same problems or interests. Ways to facilitate the entire range of
adult learning, including helping learners locate materials or
information sources, are suggested. The philosophy of a group called
"Writers in the Public Interest" is described. Suggestions on how to
support indepeudent self-directed learners and their "Invisible
University" are offered. Other topics that are addressed in the forum
include: tbe activities of people who are knowledgeable abouta
particular area, such as trains/transportation: the capacity of
libraries to meet the needs of independent learners: and academi:
credit/degrees versus noncredit/independent learning. (SW)
