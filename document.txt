ABSTRACT
A transcript of a dialogue on independent,
self-directed learning is presented. The three presenters, Ron Gross,
Tom Hebert, and Allen Tough, and audience members discuss learning,
schooling, discovery, motivation, public policy, and how all of these
affect values and the quality of life. Nonformal, nonaffiliated
learning--which takes place at home or in informal settings like
libraries, enthusiasts' clubs, and organized networks of learners--is
considered. Surveys of deliberate efforts by adults to gaini some very
definite knowledge and skill have found that 20 percent of adult
learning is planned by a professional who leads a class or group,
while 80 percent of adult learning is planned by the learner. Also
included in the 80 percent are self-help groups of peers with tha
same problems or interests. Ways to facilitate the entire range of
adult learning, including helping learners locate materials or
information sources, are suggested. The philosophy of a group called
"Writers in the Public Interest" is described. Suggestions on how to
support indepeudent self-directed learners and their "Invisible
University" are offered. Other topics that are addressed in the forum
include: tbe activities of people who are knowledgeable abouta
particular area, such as trains/transportation: the capacity of
libraries to meet the needs of independent learners: and academi:
credit/degrees versus noncredit/independent learning. (SW)

INTRODUCTION

On June 6, 1977, PECA brought its 1976-77season of the Monthly
Dialogue on Lifelong Learning to a grand finale. Three self-
directed, independent learners, Ron Gross, Tom Hebert and Allen
Tough, presented a sparkling colloquy on "Independent, Self-
Directed Learners in American Life: The Other 80% of Learning."
A little bit aboutour presenters:

- RON GROSS is author of the two Ford Foundation-sponsored
reports -- _Higher/Wider Education_ and _New Paths to Learning_ --
and the upcoming _The Lifelong Learner_ (Simon and Schuster).
He is also adjunct Professor of Social Thought at New York
University and Founder-Director ofWriters in the Public
Interest.

- TOM HEBERT is co-author of three bookson lifelong learning --
_This Way Out_, _By Hand_ (Crafts), And _Getting Skilled_.

- ALLEN TOUGH is Associate Professor of Adult Education at the
Ontario Institute for Studies in Education where he authored
_Adults' Learning Projects_. He is currently directing a long-
term research project on independent learning.

What follows is a transcript of those proceedings. Those of you
who attended will be reminded of the dynamic interchange at that
session -- replete with props, signs, hand-outs, audience participation
and the Gross-Hebert-Tough tee-shirs, specially lettered
with "The Other 80% of Learning," "The Invisible University" and
"Amateur League of Scholars-- a good book and a lamp to read it
by."

To all its readers, this text provides refreshing, sometimes
startling insights on learning, schooling, discovery, motivation,
public policy and how all of these impact on our values 'and the
quality of our lives. You will find out more about non-formal,
nonaffiliated learning -- the 80% which takes place in the home
or informal settings like libraries, enthusiasts' clubs and
organized networks of learners.
